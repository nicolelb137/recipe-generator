<br />
<br />
### **One-Pan Chicken and Veggies Recipe**
<br />
<br />
**Ingredients:**<br />
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)<br />
- 2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder<br />
- 1 teaspoon onion powder<br />
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano<br />
- 1 teaspoon paprika<br />
- Salt and pepper to taste<br />
- 1 cup baby carrots<br />
- 1 cup broccoli florets<br />
- 1 cup diced potatoes (or use sweet potatoes for a healthier option)<br />
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)<br />
<br />
**Instructions:**
<br />
1. **Preheat the oven** to 400째F (200째C).<br />
2. **Prepare the chicken**: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Rub them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper on both sides.<br />
3. **Prepare the veggies**: In a large bowl, toss the baby carrots, broccoli florets, and diced potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with a little salt and pepper.<br />
4. **Assemble**: On a baking sheet, place the chicken in the center, and arrange the veggies around the chicken.<br />
5. **Bake**: Place the pan in the oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C) and the vegetables are tender.<br />
6. **Serve**: Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Serve everything directly from the pan for easy cleanup.<br />
<br />
**Tips:**<br />
- You can use any vegetables you like (e.g., zucchini, bell peppers, or asparagus).<br />
- Add a squeeze of lemon juice over the chicken and veggies for a fresh touch after baking.<br />
<br />
Enjoy this simple and nutritious meal!<br />
